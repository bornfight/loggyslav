> Loggyslav is an npm module which easily attaches to any `class`, `method` or `property` and watches for any call or change.

> When attached to a `method` it can easily track every time it is called. It can log `input parameters` and `return value`.

> When attached to a `property` it can easily track every time it is updated.
